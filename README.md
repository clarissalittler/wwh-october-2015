Repo for my slides for a talk I'm giving.

So now the time of this talk is in the past and I gave it in the month of October.

I'll be revising and tidying these slides a little bit, making a new branch to preserve the as-given slides from this talk.

If anything you see here interests you, please feel free to contact me because I have many many opinions on these topics and would love more opportunities to ramble about them.
