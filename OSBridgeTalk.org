* The Problem With Privacy
** Safety on the internet
*** My position
    Everyone should have the right to participate in the public internet without fear of harassment either online or off.
** What should privacy mean in social media?
*** 
    Having control over your content: both who can see it, how they can interact with it, and what happens when its shared.
** What privacy features we want
** What social media gives us
** Privacy on Facebook
** Privacy on Twitter
   + Blocking \pause
   + Locking down \pause
   + ... \pause
   + No, really, *that's it*
** Privacy on Tumblr 
** Why it's not enough
* Social Contracts and Offline Conversations
** Privacy offline
   + Offline privacy is subtle and nuanced \pause
   + Social graph is more controlled \pause
   + "Don't tell Clarissa but..." \pause
   + "Well it's not official yet..." 
** In a restaurant

** Interrupting strangers

** Public but inaccessible
*** 
    You can witness conversations without having expectation of being able to participate or 
    interact with them. There's no expectation that you should be on even footing with all participants.
** Fine grained social permissions
*** 
    + Many nuanced situations offline \pause
    + Public but inaccessible has little analogue in social meda \pause
    + Expectation of how information will flow
** Social contracts and enforcement
    + How do we stop poor behavior? \pause
    + Social not legal consequences \pause
    + Being cut off from friends is meaningful
* Why Is The Internet Different?
** Anonymity

** Scaling

** Rapidity

** Incentives and social contracts
*** Why do we behave?
    We don't treat people appropriately  
** My thesis
*** 
    There should not be a fundamental difference between online and offline interactions in terms of expectations of privacy and information control.
* Operating Systems and Security
** What are capabilities?
   + Protected pointers to resources \pause
   + A pointer with permissions \pause
   + Both a way to access... \pause
   + And a way to control access 
** Capabilities in operating systems
   + Example: pointer to a file \pause
     + Read \pause
     + Write \pause
     + Execute \pause
     + /Share/ \pause
     + /Change permissions/
** 
* What Could Social Networks Be?
** Permissions
   + Reply \pause
   + Share \pause
   + Share with comment \pause
   + Change permissions
** Posts as capabilities
** Timelines as working sets
   
** Permissions and sharing
* Conclusions and Open Questions
** What we've covered
** What could be
** Analysing incentives
** Next steps
** Questions?
