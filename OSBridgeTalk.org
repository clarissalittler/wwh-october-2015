* The Problem With Privacy
** Safety on the internet
*** My position
    Everyone should have the right to participate in the public internet without fear of harassment either online or off
** What should privacy mean in social media?
*** Information flow as generalized privacy
    \pause
    Having control over your content: both who can see it, how they can interact with it, and what happens when its shared
** What privacy features we want
   + Fine grained control over visibility \pause
   + ... and over allowed *interaction* \pause
   + Sharing respects *your* preferences
** What privacy features we want
   + Choose when you become viral \pause
   + Choose when you want comments \pause
   + Choose who can share \pause
   + ...
** What social media gives us
   + Limited control over visibility \pause
   + No revocation \pause
   + Little control over interactions \pause
   + Sharing changes ownership \pause
     + Possession is 9/10 of the law
** Review of social networks
   + Reviewing privacy features \pause
   + Three general networks \pause
     + Facebook \pause
     + Tumblr \pause
     + Twitter
** Privacy on Facebook
   + Most flexible \pause
   + Can choose who can see (or can't see) posts \pause
   + Can lock down personal information selectively
** Privacy on Tumblr
   + Blocking \pause
   + Being visible only to logged in users \pause
   + Can declare blanket no-replies \pause
   + Being unsearchable
** Privacy on Twitter
   + Blocking \pause
   + Locking down \pause
   + ... \pause
   + No, really, *that's it*
** Why it's not enough
   + Can control who /sees/ posts \pause
   + ...but not how they interact with it \pause
   + No revocation \pause
     + "The Internet is Forever" \pause
   + No general flow control
* Social Contracts and Offline Conversations
** Privacy offline
   + Offline privacy is subtle and nuanced \pause
   + Social graph is more controlled \pause
     + "Don't tell Clarissa but..." \pause
     + "Well it's not official yet..." \pause
   + Social expectation

** Public but inaccessible
*** 
    You can witness conversations without having expectation of being able to participate or 
    interact with them. 
\pause
*** 
    #+LaTeX: {\Large
    *There's no expectation that all participants are on even footing.*

** Fine grained social permissions
*** 
    + Many nuanced situations offline \pause
    + Public but inaccessible \pause
    + Expectation of how information will flow \pause
    + How is this enforced?
** Social contracts and enforcement
    + How do we stop poor behavior? \pause
    + Social not legal consequences \pause
    + Being cut off from friends is meaningful \pause
    + Public humiliation is a powerful force
* Why Is The Internet Different?
** What's different about social media?
***    
    Why isn't social media like older forms of communication?
** Anonymity

** Scaling and rapidity
[[file:popularpost.png][file:~/projects/wwh-october-2015/popularpost.png]]
** Incentives and social contracts
   + Being blocked isn't a disincentive \pause
   + Groups are rapid forming and loose knit \pause
   + Humiliation, where is thy sting? \pause
   + "Stop whinging. It's the internet!"
** My thesis
*** 
    There should not be a fundamental difference between online and offline interactions in terms of expectations of privacy and information control. 
* Social Media and Permissions
** Current social media
   + Mostly all or nothing \pause
   + No equivalent of public but inaccessible \pause
   + All possible ways of interacting are lumped together
** How do we get there?
   + Control interaction and flow not just visibility \pause
   + Social expectation must be set in policy
** Permissions in social media
*** What kinds of interaction?
    \pause
     + Sharing a post \pause
       + Sharing with commentary \pause
       + Sharing and changing tags \pause
     + Conversing on a post \pause
     + Replying to a post
* Assigning permissions in operating systems and social networks
** Who gets these permission?
   + Policy controls permissions \pause
   + How do we set policy \pause
   + How do policy and sharing interact?
** Role based access control
   + Control access by assigning roles \pause
   + Groups in Linux \pause
   + Databases \pause
   + Permissions-by-job
** Role based in social media
   + Facebook's custom groups \pause
   + Google+'s circles \pause
   + Dreamwidth/LJ custom groups \pause
   + Still no disentangling of permissions
** Role based + fine-grained permissions
   + Massive improvement \pause
   + Make it easier to protect data \pause
   + Not the best though \pause
     + When I share I "own" it
** What are capabilities?
   + Unforgeable pointers to resources \pause
   + A pointer with permissions \pause
   + Both a way to access... \pause
   + And a way to control access 
** Capabilities in operating systems
   + Example: pointer to a file \pause
     + Read \pause
     + Write \pause
     + Execute \pause
     + /Share/ \pause
     + /Change permissions/
** Capabilities aren't policy
*** 
   Capabilities are issued in /accordance/ with policy. The agents must share responsibly.
** Principle of least privilege
*** 
   Only give the privilege necessary to get the job done
** Focusing on Posts
   + What if we focused on permissions attached to the post \pause
   + Better enforceable policies \pause
   + Principle of least privilege
** Posts with metadata
   + A post is /already/ content and metadata \pause
   + Who retweeted it from whom \pause
   + Reblogs and commentary of reblogs \pause
   + Proposal: add permissions as metadata on posts
** Posts as capabilities
*** The basic idea
   Posts with permissions attached should be thought of as capabilities
** Timelines as working sets
   + To view a post is to be allowed to "get" the capability \pause
   + Your timeline becomes the "working set"
** Permissions and sharing
   + Users "get" a post with certain permissions \pause
   + Sharing gives your followers copies of posts \pause
   + ...with what permissions?
** Permissions and sharing 
   + Permissions are on the post
   + Changing permissions \pause
   + Permission to change permissions \pause
   + Downgrading permissions
** Logged out users
   + Logged out users shouldn't see anything \pause
   + The most respectful choice \pause
   + But what does this do to indexing? \pause
   + Should we care?
* Revocation and Blocking
** Revocation
   + Sharing forms a tree \pause
   + Sharing information is already tracked \pause
   + The tree should be prunable at specific points
** Traditional blocking
   + A user blocks another users \pause
   + Global block from interaction \pause
   + Doesn't have clear sharing semantics
** Per-post block lists
   + Per post blocking \pause
   + Posts accumulate blocks as they're shared \pause
   + Different sharing paths accumulate different blocks \pause
   + ...but is that bad?
* New forms of permission
** New kinds of control
*** 
Post-centered thinking leads to new kinds of control over your posts.
** Tagging control
   + Preventing the adding or removing of tags \pause
   + Preventing the ability to toggle searchability
** Self-destructing messages
[[file:selfdestruct.png][file:~/projects/wwh-october-2015/selfdestruct.png]]
** Message depth
   Controlling the depth of the sharing tree: beyond a certain point no more sharing can happen
* How it might work
** Making policy
*** 
    With this fine-grained customization, we need a good user interface and sensible defaults
** Making policy
   + Role-based defaults for assigning permissions \pause
   + Can override roles whenever needed \pause
   + Setting permissions defaults by *tag* \pause
   + Most uses are simple
* Use cases
** Announcements
*** 
    You have a professional account for your business, and you want to make an announcement that can be shared but don't want anyone to comment or reply to it.
** Preventing pile-on
*** 
    Someone says something that you think was inappropriate, and you want to comment but I don't want to encourage your followers to pile on
** Preventing harassment
*** 
    You want to talk about a topic that has been *targeted for harassment* and you still want to be able to use relevant tags
* Conclusions and Open Questions
** What we've covered
   + Problems with privacy in social media \pause
   + The differences between social media and real life \pause
   + Why social pressure isn't good enough \pause
   + Posts should have permissions attached \pause
   + Capabilities provide good intuition
** Next steps
   + A proof of concept \pause
   + Formalizing interactions in social media \pause
   + Understanding incentives to change behavior
** Analyzing incentives
   + Analyzing social media game theoretically \pause
   + Devise systems that disincentivize poor behavior \pause
   + *A long way off*
