   + Review the way the Big Three of social networks handle privacy
   + Discuss the kinds of privacy we'd expect to have online
   + Briefly introduce various security and privacy models relevant to operating systems
   + Discuss ways we can try to do better with privacy

    + a fully fledged design of a new social network
    + the solution to all of our problems
    + a heartbreaking work of staggering genius
** Defining Our Terms
   + Social network \pause
   + Post \pause
   + Sharing
** Interacting With Content
   + viewing
   + replying
   + sharing
   + sharing with commentary
** What Is The Problem?
   + Harassment \pause
   + Loss of control \pause
   + Mob behavior \pause
   + Contextless quoting
** Controlling Content
   + Sharing and reading should be separate permissions \pause
   + Sharing and commenting should also be separate permissions \pause
   + Controls over 
** Feeling Safe
   + Old adage: You can't solve social problems with technical solutions \pause
   + But maybe we can *help*
* Failing of Current Networks
** Facebook
   + Most flexible of the Big Three
     + Allows you to create custom filters
     + Allows friends, friends of friends, and public as tiers
   + Viewing and commenting and sharing are entangled
   + (in my opinion) the least flexible in content creation itself
** Twitter 
   + only two privacy methods \pause
     1) blocking
     2) locking down \pause
   + No way to control sharing of a public tweet
** Tumblr
   + two privacy methods \pause
   + really mediocre blocking \pause
   + completely making your site inaccessible from the web
* Conversations in Person
** Face-to-Face
   + Face to face conversations are
     + more personal \pause
     + have an expectation of discretion in sharing \pause
   + Even in a public place, expectation of privacy
     + different tiers of expectation
** Interrupting Strangers
*** Restaurant 							    :B_block:

    :END:
    Imagine you're overhearing strangers in a restaurant, talking about a topic you have strong opinions on. You walk over to their table and start talking to them. Rude or reasonable?
\pause
*** Hackathon 							    :B_block:

    :END:
    Imagine you're overhearing strangers at a hackathon, talking about a topic you have strong opinions on. You scootch your chair over and start talking to them. Rude or reasonable?

    What's the difference?
** What's the analogue of public face-to-face?
   + Not DMs/PMs \pause
     + Those are private communication \pause
   + In no social media is there a clear equivalent \pause
   + But there *should* be \pause
     + Choosing 
** Small Scale vs. Large Scale Responses
** Don't Tell [REDACTED]
   + Sometimes information has to remain protected \pause
   + Some individuals should be excluded \pause
* Privacy in Operating Systems
** Control flow of secrecy
   + information flows low to high \pause
   + Read high security \pause => can't write low security \pause
   + A system of labels \pause
   + Bell-LaPadula \pause 
** Lattice of labels
*** Secrecy levels 						    :B_block:

   {Top-secret, secret, public}

** Capabilities in Operating Systems
   + special pointers to resources \pause
   + contain permissions for how to access the resource \pause
     + reading \pause
     + writing \pause
     + sharing
** Capabilities don't need to be checked
   + possession is 9/10 of the law \pause
   + sharing hands over a capability \pause
   + sharing is itself a permission
** Capabilities don't ensure security
   + resource with permissions \pause
   + policy determines how permissions are given \pause
   + policy maker has to enforce policy
* Privacy in Social Networks
** Posts as Capabilities
   + followers get pointers to posts with permissions \pause
   + a capability \pause
   + permissions include \pause
     + view \pause
     + share \pause
     + reply \pause
     + share with comment \pause
     + change permissions
** Secrecy as Applied to Social Media
   + Imagine labeling users as \pause
     + trusted \pause
     + untrusted \pause
     + dangerous \pause
     + coworker \pause
     + boss \pause
   + Every post is similarly labeled
** Policy Enforcement
   + 
** What does this buy us?
   + social network -> trusted network \pause
   + more careful curation
** Example Policy
   + Trusted users can see and repost and comment \pause
   + Neutral users can see and repost \pause
   + Unstrusted users can only see \pause
   + Dangerous users can't even see
** Observations    
** Access Control Lists
** Capabilities
   + Capabilities 
* What Could a New Social Network Look Like?
** Control over Viewing
   + When you make a post you control who sees it \pause
     + Even when shared by others
     + Even when commented on
     + And changes should be retroactive
** Control over Sharing
** Control over Commenting
** Setting Layers of Privacy
** Friends, Enemies, and Various Frenemic Configurations
* Open Problems
** In Which I Advocate Against Myself
** A Question of Performance
