*** What it is							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
   + Review the way the Big Three of social networks handle privacy \pause
   + Review the differences and similarities with offline privacy \pause
   + Discuss the kinds of privacy we'd want to have \pause
   + Cover how operating system security can inspire social media privacy 
** What this talk is and isn't
*** What it ain't						    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    + a full design of a new social network \pause
    + the solution to all of our problems \pause
    + a heartbreaking work of staggering genius
** Defining Our Terms
   + Social network \pause
   + Post \pause
   + Sharing \pause
   + Commenting \pause
   + Conversing \pause
   + Replying
** Feeling Safe

    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
   In order to continue using social networks, we need better ways of controlling conversations. The current state isn't sustainable.

Operating system security and offline courtesy might inspire social media privacy solutions.
   
** The Big 3
   \pause
   + Facebook \pause
   + Twitter \pause
   + Tumblr
** Facebook
   + Most flexible of the Big Three \pause
     + Allows you to create custom filters \pause
     + Allows friends, friends of friends, and public as tiers \pause
   + Viewing and commenting and sharing are entangled
** Twitter 
   + only two privacy methods \pause
     1) blocking
     2) locking down \pause
   + No way to control sharing of a public tweet
** Tumblr
   + only two privacy methods \pause
     1) really mediocre blocking \pause
     2) completely making your site inaccessible from the web
* Offline Conversations
** Face-to-face conversations
*** Expectations					      :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    Conversations in person, even in public, have an expectation of privacy
** Interrupting Strangers
*** Restaurant						      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    Imagine you're overhearing strangers in a restaurant, talking about a topic you have strong opinions on. You walk over and start talking to them.
\pause
*** Hackathon						      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    Imagine you're overhearing strangers at a hackathon, talking about a topic you have strong opinions on. You scootch your chair over and start talking to them.
** Social Contracts
*** 								 
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    Social contracts mediate small communities, but is this sufficient for social networks?
** Small Scale vs. Large Scale Responses
   + One person misunderstands your point \pause
   + One person calls you an asshole \pause
   + One person yells at you for being wrong \pause
   + What about thousands? \pause
   + In a few minutes?
** A Polite Society   
   + Large scales \pause 
   + Loose knit semi-anonymous clusters \pause
   + Social exclusion isn't a penalty \pause
   + Inapppropriate behavior should be discouraged by system
* Privacy in Social Networks
** Current Social Media
   + Mostly all or nothing \pause
   + No equivalent of public but inaccessible \pause
   + All possible ways of interacting are lumped together
** Role Based Access Control
   + Control access by assigning roles \pause
   + Groups in Linux \pause
   + Databases \pause
   + Permissions-by-job
** Role Based in Social Media
   + Facebook's custom groups \pause
   + Google+'s circles \pause
   + Dreamwidth/LJ custom groups \pause
   + Still no disentangling of permissions
** Permissions in Social Media (A First Pass)
   + Seeing \pause
   + Conversing \pause
   + Replying \pause
   + Sharing/Reblogging \pause
   + Sharing w/ Comment
** Role Based + Fine-Grained Permissions
   + Massive improvement \pause
   + Make it easier to protect data \pause
   + Not the best though \pause
     + When I share I "own" it
** Focusing on Posts
   + What if we focused on permissions attached to the post \pause
   + Better enforceable policies \pause
   + Principle of least privilege
** Capabilities in Operating Systems
   + special pointers to resources \pause
   + contain permissions for how to access the resource \pause
     + reading \pause
     + writing \pause
     + sharing
** Capabilities Don't Need To Be Checked
   + possession is 9/10 of the law \pause
   + sharing hands over a capability \pause
   + sharing is itself a permission \pause
   + changing permissions is itself a permission
** Posts as Capabilities
   + followers get pointers to posts with permissions \pause
   + a capability \pause
   + permissions include \pause
     + share \pause
     + conversing \pause
     + reply \pause
     + share with comment \pause
     + change permissions \pause
     + tag-searchable
** Getting the capabilities
   + Viewing is the odd duck \pause
   + Two options \pause
     1. Handling viewing through roles \pause
     2. Per post view lists
** Per Post Block Lists
   1. a user receives a post \pause
   2. a user shares a post \pause
   3. user chooses who views \pause
   4. take the union of the block lists
** Revokable
   + Posession of capabilities can be revoked at any point \pause
   + Tree of sharing is already tracked in most sites \pause
   + Choose a place and cut it
** This Message Will Self-Destruct
   + Controlling the depth of the graph \pause
   + Count down until it can no longer be shared \pause
   + Light-weight way to control spread of information
** Capabilities Don't Ensure Security
   + resource with permissions \pause
   + policy determines how permissions are given \pause
   + policy is created separately
** Creating Policy
   + a matter of UI \pause
   + user definable defaults \pause
     + public \pause
     + work \pause
     + secure \pause
     + near private \pause
   + should be simple and flexible
* What Could a New Social Network Look Like?
** Not Piling On
   + I reblog something where I want to make a comment \pause
   + I know that there are people who follow me who'd pick a fight \pause
   + I downgrade the permissions so it is no longer commentable
** Making An Announcement
   + I want to let my followers and only my followers know something \pause
   + It is unshareable and unreply-able
** Preventing Harassment
   + I want to comment on a sensitve topic without being harassed \pause
   + I make these posts unsearchable \pause
   + I make the posts unreplyable, unshareable, uncommentable but conversable \pause
     + a public conversation with an expectation of privacy
** Conclusion
   + Separate different permissions and functions \pause
   + Capability-like view of posts \pause
   + Something needs to change
