    :END:
   + Review the way the Big Three of social networks handle privacy
   + Discuss the kinds of privacy we'd expect to have online
   + Briefly introduce various security and privacy models relevant to operating systems
   + Discuss ways we can try to do better with privacy
** What this talk is and isn't

    :END:
    + a fully fledged design of a new social network
    + the solution to all of our problems
    + a heartbreaking work of staggering genius
** Defining Our Terms
   + Social network \pause
   + Post \pause
   + Sharing
** What Is The Problem?
   + Harassment \pause
   + Loss of control \pause
   + Mob behavior \pause
   + Contextless quoting
** Controlling Content
   + Sharing and reading should be separate permissions
   + Sharing and commenting should also be separate permissions
   + 
** Feeling Safe
   + Old adage: You can't solve social problems with technical solutions \pause
   + But maybe we can *help*
* Failing of Current Networks
** Facebook
   + Most flexible of the Big Three
     + Allows you to create custom filters
     + Allows friends, friends of friends, and public as tiers
   + Viewing and commenting and sharing are entangled
   + (in my opinion) the least flexible in content creation itself
** Twitter 
   + only two privacy methods \pause
     1) blocking
     2) locking down \pause
   + No way to control sharing of a public tweet
** Tumblr
   + two privacy methods \pause
   + really mediocre blocking \pause
   + completely making your site inaccessible from the web
* Conversations in Person
** Face-to-Face
   + Face to face conversations are
     + more personal \pause
     + have an expectation of discretion in sharing \pause
   + Even in a public place, expectation of privacy
     + different tiers of expectation
** Interrupting Strangers
*** Restaurant 							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:
    Imagine you're overhearing strangers in a restaurant, talking about a topic you have strong opinions on. You walk over to their table and start talking to them. Rude or reasonable?
\pause
*** Hackathon 							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:
    Imagine you're overhearing strangers at a hackathon, talking about a topic you have strong opinions on. You scootch your chair over and start talking to them. Rude or reasonable?

    What's the difference?
** What's the analogue of public face-to-face?
   + Not DMs/PMs \pause
     + Those are private communication \pause
   + In no social media is there a clear equivalent \pause
   + But there *should* be \pause
     + 
** Small Scale vs. Large Scale Responses
** Don't Tell [REDACTED]
   + Sometimes information has to remain protected \pause
   + Some individuals should be excluded \pause
** 
* Privacy: Existing Solutions
** Integrity: Data Flows from High to Low
   + Biba integrity model \pause
   + Invented by Kenneth J. Biba in 1975 (ref) \pause
   + Measure of integrity of data \pause
   + Data can move high to low
** Integrity: Read High, Write Low				   :noexport:
** Integrity as Applied to Social Media				   :noexport:
   I'm still working on figuring out how to write this section and maybe there's not much to say
** Secrecy: Data Flows from Low to High
   + Secret information shouldn't leak \pause
   + Bell-LaPadula model of secrecy \pause
   + Security for operating systems and software
** Secrecy: Read Low, Write High
   + Bell-LaPadula says you can always makes something more secret \pause
   + Only special actors can make something less secret again \pause
   + Have an ordering to define secrecy \pause
   + 
** Secrecy as Applied to Social Media
   + Imagine labeling users as \pause
     + trusted \pause
     + neutral \pause
     + unsafe \pause
   + Label posts by the same labels \pause
   + Have a Bell-LaPadula relation of trusted > neutral > unsafe
** Access Control Lists
